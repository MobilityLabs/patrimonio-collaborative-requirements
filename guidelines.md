# User Stories/Job Stories
We prefer to use job stories when trying to give context to the problem we are solving. Job stories are a concept used by a few big names in the software space, most notably [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/). The concept is detailed [here](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/converting-to-jobs-stories) and [here](https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27). The format for a job story is as follows:

When [users work/life context] I want to [motivation] so that [outcome/benefit].

# Verifiable User Requirements
All user requirements suggested must be verfiable. The qualities of a verifiable user requirement are:
- Based on user stories
- Unambiguous
- Testable
- Atomic
- Implementation free

# Issues
Issues should be used to ask additional questions of the team. If you have questions or see issues with the way a requirement is written you may create an issue for it or if you have a suggestion, use a pull request.

## Tagging issues
To make it easier to sort issues, we are using the following tags:
- Clarification
- Missing Info
- Broken Link

Examples of issues are:
- Definition of XXXXXX is ambiguous [Clarification]
- Who is the audience for the mobile platform? [Missing Info]
- User testing for v1.0 references a document not accessible in the repo [Broken Link]
