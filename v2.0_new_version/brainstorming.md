# Brainstorming v2.0

Teachers brainstormed ways the tool could be used in the classroom for different subjects:

- one Spanish teacher imagined herself doing a virtual tour using the map while telling her students stories about national heroes
- an art teacher suggested a Play-Doh sculpting activity based on the appâ€™s images
- a math teacher wanted to use the app for test questions, such as calculating the area between a set of sculpture points.
