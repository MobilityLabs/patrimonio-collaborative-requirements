## Teachers

When I am teaching history I want to find important historical sites so that students can connect with their heritage.

When teaching geometry I want to use real locations on maps so that students are engaged with the subject.

When teaching art, I want to show students famous sculptures and achaeological findings so that students can recreate or study the real thing.


## Students

When I am doing a report on local culture I want to do a virtual tour to show my teacher I understand.
